Task0: 
1. I should first install ngnix
	sudo apt -y update
	sudo apt install -y nginx
2. I  have to create this folders if don't exist	:
	-/data/web_static/releases/
	-/data/web_static/shared/
	-/data/web_static/releases/test/
so to do that i should use mkdir with the -p option

3. I have also to create /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html html file with a  simple content for testing my nginx config

4. I should create a symbolic link between 
/data/web_static/current -> /data/web_static/releases/test/
